# Comp_arch_game

ideas for making game cooler once it is functional 
- color code feedback (green for correct, red for too high, yellow for too low)
- track history so you know how many guesses it took you
- maybe have a high score like lowest num of guesses
- maybe have different levels (easy is 1-1000, med is 1-3000, hard is 1-5000)
- use the intense with the green for when someone is correct
- track accuracy (how many guesses against how many times they were right)
